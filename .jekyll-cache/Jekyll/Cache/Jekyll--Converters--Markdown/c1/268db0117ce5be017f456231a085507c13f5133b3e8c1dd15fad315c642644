<p>First things first, why should you bother with buying instead of starting one from scratch? Because, let’s face it, even with all the tools available to you there’s still ~a lot~ of work to do.</p>

<p>First, you have to select what you want to sell. Then, you need to figure out how to actually manufacture it and get it over to your country to ship. Most likely, this means you’re working with overseas manufacturers, many of whom don’t speak english well. Then, you’ll need to create the actual storefront and all the associated graphics. Canva helps a ton with this, but unless you have a design background, it’s probably not going to end up looking very professional. That’s just some of the initial startup tasks. Unless you’ve got all of those skills, it’s going to take you many, many hours and thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Did that dampen your passion to start your own ecommerce business? Fear not, one alternative is to simply buy</p>
