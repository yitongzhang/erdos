I"<p>It’s easier than ever to get into ecommerce today.</p>

<p>There’s countless articles, guides, gurus, and discord channels channels helping someone to get started. However, if you’re new to ecommerce, this can be an intimidating start.</p>

<p>A great alternative is to start with an existing store.</p>

<p>Lucky for you, we’ve put together both an informative and entertaining (we hope) guide to start.</p>

<p>First things first, why should you bother with buying instead of starting one from scratch? Because, let’s face it, even with all the tools available to you there’s still ~a lot~ of work to do.</p>

<p>First, you have to select what you want to sell. Then, you need to figure out how to actually manufacture it and get it over to your country to ship. Most likely, this means you’re working with overseas manufacturers, many of whom don’t speak english well. Then, you’ll need to create the actual storefront and all the associated graphics. Canva helps a ton with this, but unless you have a design background, it’s probably not going to end up looking very professional. That’s just some of the initial startup tasks. Unless you’ve got all of those skills, it’s going to take you many, many hours and thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Did that dampen your passion to start your own ecommerce business? Fear not, one alternative is to simply buy a store and skip most of these steps! We’ve been around the block a few times with buying stores, and we’re more than happy to share what we’ve learned on the process.</p>

<p>One last gif to get you hyped again before we dive in!</p>

<p>Step 1: Figure out your niche and your budget.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know exactly what product you want to sell yet, but you should have an idea of what type of product you want to sell. Ideally, it’s something that you both have experience in and passion for. Don’t think you have any relevant experience? Be creative and you’ll be surprised! There’s often products that are only popular in your city that many other people don’t know about, or you have stumbled across an interesting item on Tiktok you’ve never seen before.</p>

<p>Step 2: Where to look for stores.</p>

<p>We’ve found the top sources to be: Flippa, Microacquire, and Shopify Exchange. These three sites don’t have a minimum listing price, so you’re able to often find starter businesses within everyone’s budget. They also do a great job of showing some verified data such as traffic and revenues, so you’re able to do a lot of filtering beforehand.</p>
