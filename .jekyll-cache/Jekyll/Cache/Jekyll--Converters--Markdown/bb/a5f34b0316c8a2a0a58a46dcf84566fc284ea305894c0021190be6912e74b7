<p>What Kinds of Online Businesses Can You Buy And Sell?
Here are the online businesses you can sell or purchase easily:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Content Sites/Blogs.
Nearly 2 billion blogs get published every year worldwide. In the United States alone, there are more than 30 million bloggers who post every month.</li>
</ol>

<p>Naturally, most bloggers monetize their blogs and sites since most people now use the internet as an information source. Today, content sites and blogs are lucrative businesses that you can even buy and sell online.</p>

<p>Buying.
Buying a content site or blog needs in-depth knowledge about how website monetization works. However, you can work around the complexities by gaining firsthand experience. Whether you‚Äôre starting a blog with WordPress or making a website with a popular website builder, it‚Äôs important to know what you‚Äôre getting yourself into.</p>

<p>After gaining experience, start looking out for websites that haven‚Äôt been used or updated for extended periods. With any luck, you‚Äôll find a suitable site on marketplaces like Flippa, FE International, Empire Flippers, etc.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, use social media to announce your interest in acquiring a website. Once you identify potential choices, contact the respective business owner to take your idea forward.</p>

<p>Before making the final purchase, it‚Äôs crucial to tally your short-term and long-term plans with the website‚Äôs owner.</p>

<p>At the same time, it‚Äôs essential to purchase from a recognized vendor like Flippa.</p>

<p>Purchasing your site from a trusted vendor like Flippa comes with benefits like:</p>

<p>Authentic metrics like website traffic, traffic sources, conversion rates, etc.
Get a real picture of the website and how it influences purchasing decisions.
Secure payment and transfer.
Free migration after the purchase.
Flippa website purchase options 
When you buy a website from individuals directly, ask them to prove the numbers behind their monetization claims. In such cases, a great way to avoid getting duped is by taking the advice of industry experts who can guide you better. They could also advise you on how to enhance visibility, improve traffic, and generate more passive income.</p>

<p>After you strike a deal, ensure there‚Äôs a legal contract. You may know the seller and work out personal terms without pen and paper. However, it‚Äôs better to draw up formal documents when it comes to doing business and exchanging money.</p>

<p>Selling.
The first step here is to estimate the value of your website.</p>

<p>You can evaluate your blog‚Äôs worth by taking these factors into account:</p>

<p>Cost of content development.
Your annual revenue.
Cost per visit.
In case you don‚Äôt have any annual revenue, you can make estimations based on the website‚Äôs cost.
Use statistics like website traffic and aspects like website design.
The good news is that many online marketplaces come with their own valuation tool to calculate your blog‚Äôs worth automatically.</p>

<p>Take Flippa‚Äôs valuation tool, for instance:</p>

<p>Flippa - valuation tool
Once you make up your mind, list it in the ‚ÄòFor Sale‚Äô section of online website marketplaces.</p>

<p>You can also ask around for references if you know someone personally in the industry. Learn more about how to close business deals, and always go for written documentation over word of mouth.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ecommerce Websites.
Statistics suggest that By 2040, 95% of all purchases will be via ecommerce stores. What‚Äôs more, the ecommerce industry is growing at a rate of 23% YoY. Clearly, buying or selling an ecommerce website can be quite lucrative most of the time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Buying.
Since the stakes are high, it‚Äôs best to stick to facts while purchasing an ecommerce business. Focus on what the business ‚Äòis‚Äô instead of what it ‚Äòcan be.‚Äô</p>

<p>Moreover, consider important metrics while buying an ecommerce site:</p>

<p>Annual revenue
Operating costs
Brand awareness
Cost of goods sold (COGS)
Gross profit
Since it‚Äôs likely to be a long-term investment, you might want to consider the site‚Äôs long-term potential too.</p>

<p>Try to understand why the business is for sale. And if there‚Äôs potential to increase the revenue, then why is the current owner selling it? Which ecommerce platform are they using?</p>

<p>You also need information about their order fulfillment service, dropshipping suppliers, and distributors. Simply relying on past partnerships may not be enough.</p>

<p>Dig deep into the kind of customers who visit the website and how much they spend on an average. Additionally, you‚Äôll also need to understand if most of the visits are organic or via paid marketing activities.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at an example:
Suppose the site generates $4,000 in sales everyday organically. It‚Äôs a huge bonus for you. But what if you need to spend 60% of that on paid ads? Would it be worth it for you?</p>

<p>Thus, it‚Äôs essential to identify what percentage of visitors are visiting the site organically.</p>

<p>Other than this, scrutinize the bank statements and P&amp;L statements of the business. Plus, look for tell-tale signs about the business‚Äô health and align it with your own information.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to value a business is the multiple of earnings method. Here, you decide the number of years you‚Äôre willing to wait for the business to reach the break-even point.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs how you value a business with multiple of earnings:</p>

<p>(Selling price of the business) / (Annual net income) = Years</p>

<p>So, if you are willing to wait four years for the business with an annual net income of $100,000, you can pay at most $400,000 to buy it.</p>

<p>Lastly, be careful of the expert conmen who can dupe you. Before taking a decision, carry out in-depth research about the business and listen to expert opinions.</p>

<p>Selling.
Valuing an ecommerce business built from the ground up isn‚Äôt easy.</p>

<p>To maximize the value, you can tweak a few things like:</p>

<p>Improve the website design and make it more aesthetic and appealing. It should align with the products it‚Äôs selling.
Increase the sales channels currently in use. It will offer better value to the future purchaser, and help you get a much better sale price.
Try to minimize the COGS (cost of goods sold), so you can maximize your profit margin ‚Äì another potential bargaining chip.
Try to improve the website metrics like CTR and traffic, and organically build up a social media presence. Buyers will be willing to pay more for a business with the right networks.
While selling ecommerce websites, peer-to-peer recommendations also help. Therefore, use your contacts in the business to spread the word around.</p>

<p>And as always, never rely on word of mouth. Emphasize on drawing up legal contracts, preferably in the presence of an attorney.</p>

<ol>
  <li>SaaS Companies.
SaaS businesses get valued differently than other internet businesses. For one, they are entirely cloud-based and subscription-driven.</li>
</ol>

<p>SaaS businesses are also highly lucrative since they‚Äôre scalable and applicable to a wide range of businesses.</p>

<p>Thus, it‚Äôs easy to sell and buy them online.</p>

<p>Buying.
When it comes to buying, there are usually two broad options ‚Äì either private purchase or via a vendor. And there are a lot of factors that can influence the decision, disregarding your buying medium.</p>

<p>Some of the factors to consider while buying SaaS companies are:</p>

<p>Consider Essential Metrics ‚Äì As with every business, rely on numbers and hard facts. You should study and analyze P&amp;L statements, operational costs, annual revenue, and profit margins. You can also ask for any marketing metrics like LTV:CAC, and ROAS. These metrics will influence key business decisions.
The Pricing Model ‚Äì Understand the pricing model and try to find out ways to make it better. SaaS business models offer many pricing plans, including multiple-tiered options based on customers‚Äô needs, flat pricing, etc. The number of existing customers and customer acquisition rates can also influence this decision. With the right model, it‚Äôs possible to minimize churn rates and maximize value.
Source Code ‚Äì Access to the source code is another essential consideration in a SaaS business. It‚Äôs the business owner‚Äôs exclusive property, so find out how easy it is to transfer the legal ownership.
Customer Acquisition Channels ‚Äì SaaS businesses usually have five customer acquisition channels: organic, referral, direct, paid, and social. Find out the percentage of acquisitions made by each channel. A business that relies on either organic, direct, and social channels is likely to improve your bottom lines. However, a business that relies overtly on paid advertising is unlikely to be sustainable in the long-term.
Look At The Scalability ‚Äì Can you improve customer satisfaction, enter new markets, and offer new services? Would that allow a slight increase in the pricing? All these aspects will help you determine the scalability of the SaaS business you are looking to purchase.
Selling.
Selling a SaaS business may be more lucrative than you expect.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you need to consider the type of buyer who might buy your SaaS product.</p>

<p>Here are the types of buyers who usually buy SaaS businesses:</p>

<p>Individuals
Private portfolios
Microfunds/Syndicates
Private Equity
Strategics
All these five types of investors usually fall in the $100K to $15M deal range.</p>

<p>Types of SaaS Buyers
After you discern which type of investors might buy your SaaS business, you need to evaluate your business.</p>

<p>Most SaaS businesses use two valuation methods:</p>

<p>EBITDA
Seller Discretionary Earnings (SDE)
SaaS valuation usually starts out with SDE but can change to revenue after a certain threshold. That‚Äôs why the valuation can sometimes confuse even the business owners and entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>However, you can‚Äôt evaluate your SaaS business properly without considering the revenue.</p>

<p>Plus, consult legal experts before making any deal since a SaaS business can easily get valued in millions of dollars.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Apps.
Facebook, an app barely 16 years old, has a net worth of around $530 billion today. It isn‚Äôt the only successful one in the market. And at present, there are apps for just about everything.</li>
</ol>

<p>With the number of mobile app downloads increasing by 45% over the last five years, buying an app now can be a terrific investment.</p>

<p>Buying.
Buying an app makes sense if you‚Äôre looking to leverage its competitive advantage in the market. So the first step should be to identify the business area you want to address and the service you want to provide. After that, assess the kind of app you‚Äôre looking for.</p>

<p>Not all app developers like the business end of things. Thus, apart from using your contacts to look out for potential sellers, you can also signup with online marketplaces.</p>

<p>While judging an app by its appearance and user-friendliness is essential, it shouldn‚Äôt be your only concern.</p>

<p>You should also focus on aspects like:</p>

<p>Whether it‚Äôs a paid app or a free one.
Estimated downloads.
Monthly traffic of the app.
The median age group of users.
User reviews.
Monetization channels.
Don‚Äôt just settle for the words of the developer. Check out the metrics for yourself and understand the aspects that can help achieve your business goals. Plus, try to discern the areas that you can improve.</p>

<p>Other than this, try to understand why the owner wants to sell the app. Look out for any trouble with the source code, its working condition, and its ownership.</p>

<p>You might also want to get the industry perspective on the app‚Äôs competitors and valuation. Since there are so many apps in the market, it‚Äôs easy to get overcharged. For example, the average app listed on ‚ÄòApptopia‚Äô costs $7500. So if you‚Äôre getting charged $15,000 for something similar, you can take a stand.</p>

<p>Selling.
App developers with no interest in the business side of things are prone to selling apps. If you‚Äôre one of them, the first to do is send out the word through your acquaintances.</p>

<p>Online presence on social media can enhance your reach to potential customers exponentially. If you‚Äôve got it, make sure to advertise your intentions.</p>

<p>However, putting a value on an app for sale isn‚Äôt easy.</p>

<p>The pricing will vary based on a few factors:</p>

<p>Whether you developed the app yourself or you employed a developer
The annual revenue (including subscriptions, if any)
The number of users
Average downloads per year
Avoid overpricing your app since there are a large number of apps for every business or niche. The best idea is to keep it in sync with the industry-standard rate and be a responsive seller.</p>

<p>Because of the competition, it‚Äôs essential to respond to emails, calls, and queries in time. Also, make sure to address all the doubts of potential customers politely.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Domain Names.
With all the world‚Äôs businesses coming online, everyone requires catchy domain names to attract customers. There were 367 million domain name registrations in the first quarter of 2020 itself. Therefore, buying or selling the right domain names can have good business value in the present times.</li>
</ol>

<p>Buying.
Naturally, you would want to choose an interesting domain name. It‚Äôs the first thing that your audience will notice about your business, so you need to make it as engaging as possible. Plus, it has to be relevant to your business, unless you go for something abstract like ‚ÄòGoogle.‚Äô</p>

<p>Besides this, check that it‚Äôs not already in use by someone else, and there isn‚Äôt any copyright infringement.</p>

<p>For that, you need to use domain name checkers like Hostinger Domain Checker.</p>

<p>Hostinger Domain Checker
You can find all the available domain names that are up for purchase. Plus, ensure that the name can reflect your business ethos and focus area precisely. You can proceed with the purchase once you select the domain name.</p>

<p>The entire process is quick since it‚Äôs online and seldom requires a pen and paper. You usually get an email with all the details of the purchase, receipts, invoices, and an activation link.</p>

<p>Just log in, verify the account, and start using it right away.</p>

<p>Selling.
The first step here is to value your domain name properly. Just because you owned the business and ran it for some time doesn‚Äôt mean it will sell for a high price.</p>

<p>You can start by referring to online marketplaces and analyzing the pricing of similar domain names.</p>

<p>Check out the domain name listings by Flippa:</p>

<p>domain name listings - Flippa
You can observe the expected prices of domain names similar to yours and price it accordingly.</p>

<p>To sell your domain name, you either spread the word around through your industry contacts or list it on online marketplaces. Highlight your other business ventures and the merits of your business to make it more appealing.</p>

<p>Make sure you publicly list your contact information so potential buyers can reach you readily. Plus, ensure that you‚Äôre always accessible via the WHOIS directory.</p>

<p>What Should You Look For When Purchasing An Online Business?
Not everyone likes the idea of starting an online business from scratch. Plus, buying an existing business comes with plenty of benefits. That said, the business you buy should have a proven history of revenue generation and immediate cash flow.</p>

<p>Here are some things to consider while buying an online business.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Monthly Traffic.
Monthly traffic is one of the essential metrics to look for while buying an online business. Additionally, look for diversity in traffic.</li>
</ol>

<p>It should be a healthy mix of:</p>

<p>Organic traffic
Paid traffic
Direct
Social Media Traffic
Referral Traffic
You can use tools like Google Analytics to find out how the traffic is coming to the store. Plus, check if the site has high-quality backlinks as such sites are worth more than sites with no or low-quality backlinks. In this case, you can use tools like Ahrefs and Open Site Explorer to look into a site‚Äôs backlink profile.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Revenue Generation.
Taking the risk to revive a failed business is not worth it unless you are very skilled or experienced. Therefore, choose a business with growing revenue.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ask for the financial data in monthly increments. It will give you a clear idea in which direction the business is heading.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Expenses.
Take a look at the expenses like website hosting, domain renewals, digital marketing, SEO, etc. At the same time, ensure that the owner is practicing smart spending habits. If not, you can reallocate spending to increase profits.</li>
</ol>

<p>It‚Äôs equally important to look for expenses that appear irrationally low or those that the owner didn‚Äôt mention. Such expenses include payment processor fees, reimbursements for integrations &amp; plugins, etc.</p>

<p>All in all, it‚Äôs not a good idea to buy a business that requires more expenses than the annual income.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Growth Potential.
The right business you are going to purchase may seem maxed out to its potential. But there are always some ways to add values.</li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe the owner never hired a Conversion Rate Optimization service before. You can hire one and audit the business website for loopholes in the conversion process.</p>

<p>You can even start a dynamic social media marketing campaign. There are so many ways to try out and scale your business. However, avoid buying a business that shows little to no growth potential.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Find Out The Reason For the Sale.
Finding the reason why the owner is selling their business is crucial. If the reasons they give raise any red flags (like unprofitability or lack of traffic) ‚Äì it‚Äôs better to look for another business. Knowing the reasons will let you decide whether you can handle them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Customer Reviews.
Finally, find out whether current customers are happy with the business or not. It will give you accurate insights into the business you are going to purchase.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It‚Äôs better to purchase an established business, especially if you don‚Äôt want to start a business from scratch. But look for the right things, lest you end up spending on an unlucrative business.</p>

<p>How Do You Price Online Businesses?
Here are a few steps to price your online business:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Identify The Business Model.
First, recognize the business model. There can be many of them online, including a full service turnkey solution, product-based, step by step lead generation business, real estate websites, done for you advertising, subscription-based, and more. You need a business whose revenue model aligns with your short and long-term strategies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Look at The Essential Metrics.
Next, you need to look into the balance sheets and the P&amp;L statements. Plus, evaluate all the metrics like annual revenue, gross &amp; net profits, and the COGS. They reflect the financial health of the business and determine its sustainability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Different Modes of Valuation.
Valuation of a business can be taxing. Each business is different than the other, and so are the modes of valuation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Take ecommerce business valuation, for example. In this case, most companies multiply annual revenue by a factor of 3 and arrive at the valuation. For online content sites or blogs, the final worth gets calculated by multiplying with 6. You may still not be sure, but this method can alleviate some confusion.</p>

<p>Other than this, you can also use valuation tools offered by most marketplaces like Flippa, FE International, etc.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Study Annual Expenses.
If you want to buy online business for sale, it makes sense to study and compare the total annual expenses with the annual revenue while buying an online business.</li>
</ol>

<p>Investing in a business whose expenses can climb up to 75% of the annual revenue isn‚Äôt a good idea. In such cases, the annual expenses might overtake revenue in a highly inflationary market.</p>

<p>Ultimately, an internet business‚Äôs proper pricing depends on your knowledge of the market, budget, and future goals.</p>

<p>Executive Summary.
If you decide to buy or sell a business, success depends on a lot of factors: the size of your business, annual revenue, marketing channels, branding, growth, metrics, and more.</p>

<p>If you want to attract international buyers, then FE International is an excellent option. Flippa is a great platform to buy or sell startups and small businesses easily. For large technology businesses and assistance with every aspect of the deal, I‚Äôd suggest Digital Exits.</p>

<p>My top pick is Flippa since it provides benefits like:</p>

<p>Escrow service for secure payments.
Most diverse business categories.
Easy to navigate.
The choice to hire a broker who can handle the entire process for you.

The fact that it‚Äôs one of the biggest marketplaces to buy and sell online business also makes it a great option.</p>
